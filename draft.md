title: The Arm-Wrestling Contest
subtitle: Or, Why I Ditched Opposed Rolls
---

Imagine our RPG is hosting an arm-wrestling contest.  All of our contestants have a Strength (STR) ability score, generated by rolling **3d6**.  This gives us 16 possible strength scores ranging from 3 to 18, representing the full range of human ability.  How do we determine the winner?

In the first corner, this pitiful little Goblin!

![A pitiful little goblin](/images/goblin.png)

* He rolled all ones on his STR roll
* He's as weak as the weakest ~6% of humans
* There's no way he's gonna win this thing.

In the next corner, this mighty Ogre!

![A massive, flexing ogre](/images/ogre.jpg)

* She rolled all sixes on her STR roll
* She's as strong as the strongest ~6% of humans
* She's a lock to win this.

So, how do we determine who wins the arm wrestling contest?

We could just compare strength scores directly, but then the Ogre ALWAYS wins.  Surely there's some set of circumstances, however unlikely, where the Goblin wins?  So we'll randomize the outcome by having each contestant roll a **d20**.

Our Goblin rolled a **12**, and our Ogre rolled **9**.  How do we incorporate our STR?

### Roll-High: Add a Modifier

For the last 20 years of D&D, we start by converting our ability score into a **modifier** - subtract 10, divide by 2, and round down, like so:

|  STR   | Mod |  STR   | Mod |  STR   | Mod |  STR  | Mod |
|--------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----|-------|-----|
| **18** | +4  | **14** | +2  | **10** |  0  | **6** | -2  |
| **17** | +3  | **13** | +1  | **9**  | -1  | **5** | -3  |
| **16** | +3  | **12** | +1  | **8**  | -1  | **4** | -3  |
| **15** | +2  | **11** |  0  | **7**  | -2  | **3** | -4  |

Modifiers range from **-4** to **+4**, which we add to our d20 roll when making ability checks.

When two characters roll against each other (an **opposed roll**), the highest roll+modifier wins (a **roll-high** system).  Once we've got these modifiers captured on the character sheet, this approach is straightforward and intuitive - add your modifier, higher is better.

Our Goblin has a modifier of **-4**, and our Ogre has a modifier of **+4**.  After adding their modifiers to their rolls, our Goblin has an 8, and our Ogre has a 13 - the Ogre wins!

Looking at the odds, though, our [Ogre will roll above the Goblin ~81% of the time](https://anydice.com/program/1f8b3).  But our Ogre is a beefcake and the Goblin is puny - how could the Goblin still win ~17% of the time?  

Well, this process is compressing our ability scores from 3-18 into a relatively small range of modifiers, and we lose granularity.  For example, STR 10 vs. STR 13 is mechanically identical to STR 11 vs. STR 12.  This compression becomes particularly evident with opposed rolls.

### Roll-Under: Rolling directly against our STR

Modifiers have been standard fare in D&D since 2000 with 3rd Edition, but previous editions use **roll-under** checks - roll at-or-below your ability score to succeed.  Some editions only consider rolling under a success, but same idea.

Roll-under has some distinct advantantages over modifiers: a d20 fits nicely across our 3-18 scale, and every point of STR counts, with no compression.

Can we use roll-under for opposed checks?  If the Goblin and Ogre both roll STR checks, [there's a ~76% chance the Ogre passes and the Goblin does not](https://anydice.com/program/1f8c0) - pretty comparable to the 80% of our modifier approach.  As above, the Goblin's original roll of 12 fails and the Ogre's roll of 9 succeeds.

But what if they both pass, or both fail?  If our Ogre and Goblin both roll a 1, who wins?

We could add some kind of tiebreaker, say, comparing STR scores, whenever both contestants pass or fail. But this chance of tiebreakers increases as the STR spread narrows.  [A STR 17 Ogre and STR 18 Ogre will tie 78% of the time](https://anydice.com/program/1f8c1).  We'd expect the odds for these Ogres to be near 50/50, but instead the STR 18 Ogre will win 92% of the time.

### Roll-High-Under: Ability Score Blackjack

There's another d20 mechanic called **roll-high-under**, used most notably in old-school-D&D-inspired [Whitehack](https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/).  Also known as "Blackjack" rolling, I describe this to players as "Price Is Right" rules - roll at-or-under your ability score, *the higher the better*.

Unlike roll-under systems, we can resolve our opposed rolls if both succeed - the higher roll wins.  With roll-high-under, [our Goblin now only wins ~9% of the time](https://anydice.com/program/1f8c5), which feels a little more reasonable.

Roll-high-under has other perks - see Whitehack's slick handling of Armor Class - but it's not without its faults.  For example, what happens if both contestants fail their rolls?  We might say the contestants are locked in struggle, and have them both reroll.  But imagine two STR 3 Goblins - [they'll both fail their STR check 72% of the time](https://anydice.com/program/1f8c7), and will require ~4 rolls on average to determine a winner.

But there's another, more practical problem with roll-high-under systems.  Despite its elegance, roll-high-under can be slow and unintuitive for players at the table.

For example, how do we handle critical successes and fumbles?  In a roll-high system, rolling 20 is best and 1 is worst.  For roll-under systems, this is reversed - 1 good, 20 bad.  This can be an adjustment for players raised on modern D&D, but it's still immediately recognizable the moment the die finishes rolling.

But for roll-high-under systems, a critical success is *rolling your ability score exactly*.  This might be recognizable to the player who rolled it, but often results in them double-checking their character sheet, and means a delayed reaction at best for the rest of the table.  It's a small detail, but can make a big difference in the energy and excitement of rolling dice.

### A hero walks into the bar..

Not just any hero either, but a Player Character, who's sitting at our game table.  This means our Goblin and Ogre must be non-player characters, with their fate in the hands of the GM.  Does this change our scenario?  Should the GM roll dice to determine the outcome of the Goblin and Ogre's arm-wrestling match?

Consider the case where the Goblin wins.  Sure, it's unlikely, but entirely possible.  So the GM explains: the Goblin and Ogre compete, and the Goblin emerges victorious.

The players look at the GM - huh?  How did the Ogre lose?  _Why_ did the Goblin win?  "He just got lucky with the dice" is not a satisfactory explanation.

The fiction matters.  Think quick.

* Maybe the Goblin had an incredible breakfast that morning.
* Maybe the Goblin spotted his long-lost father in the crowd.
* Maybe the Goblin's favorite song just came on the jukebox.
* Maybe the Ogre ate bad sushi for lunch.
* Maybe the Ogre just remembered she left her front door unlocked.
* Maybe the Ogre is on a ten-match losing streak and has a terrible case of The Yips.

Now the players are intrigued.  And who can blame them?  This is unusual - maybe they can use this to their advantage somehow?  The Goblin-Ogre Upset could derail the whole session, as it provides lots of hooks for players to investigate.  Maybe they attend the Goblin celebration after-party.  Maybe they console the dejected Ogre.  Maybe they hassle their bookie for better odds next time.  What started as one random quirk of the dice has now become canon in-game.

Mostly?  This is fine!  Just a fun bit of color.  But as GM, did we really *need* the dice here?

If we wanted the upset as a plot device - and maybe had prepped some ideas to develop it - why would we leave this up to a 1-in-10 dice roll?  Conversely, if the Ogre was sure to win, why would we bother rolling?  As GM, we can always just declare a winner among NPCs, however best serves the fiction of the game.

### Our hero enters the contest.

The next challenger - our perfectly average Player Character!

![An entirely average human](/images/average_human.jpg)

They rolled a STR of 10, entirely middle-of-the-road.

We can't just declare a winner here - our Player expects to roll some dice to determine their fate.  What are our options?

Well, we could do an opposed roll, with the GM rolling on behalf of their opponent.

If we're playing Modern D&D, our Player gets a +0 modifier to add to their roll.  Against the Ogre, [our Player has a 30% chance of winning](https://anydice.com/program/1f8cf), and [a 66% chance of winning against the Goblin](https://anydice.com/program/1f8d0).  This.. seems wrong.  Even our decidely-average Player should still almost always beat the Goblin, at least more than two-thirds of the time.

What if we're playing a roll-high-under system?  Well, the odds are a bit more realistic - [our Player has a 16% chance of beating the Ogre](https://anydice.com/program/1f97b), and [only an 8% chance of losing to the Goblin](https://anydice.com/program/1f97e).  But our roll-high-under issues persist - there's a 43% chance the Player will *tie* against the Goblin, which seems strange.

So here is our predicament:

* The Player expects to roll dice to determine whether they beat their opponent.
* The Player should almost always beat the Goblin and almost always lose to the Ogre.
* Our process should be intuitive and decisive, and avoid complicated math and rerolls.
* The odds should be easy to reckon, so players can decide if it's worth the risk.

### Do we really need opposed rolls?

So much of the math here is complicated by comparing the outcome of two opposed rolls.  What if we ditch it?

After all, we only really *need* the Player to roll - the Goblin and Ogre are just NPCs.  As long as the odds still make sense, this would greatly simplifies our procedure.  Is it possible for the Player's roll alone to determine the outcome?

In fact, this approach works pretty well with ability score modifiers.  The GM just sets a static target to beat (Difficulty Class, or **DC**) for each opponent - a low DC for Goblin and a high DC for the Ogre.  We could even use their opponent's STR as DC!  This gives us [a 90% chance of beating the Goblin and a 15% chance of beating the Ogre](https://anydice.com/program/1f981).  To me, this feels much more plausible than the opposed modifier odds, with a much simpler process to boot.

The main flaw with this approach is the same as before - our modifier lacks granularity.  We only see a 5% difference between a STR 10 (+0) and a STR 13 (+1) character.

And as players get stronger, it also becomes impossible for the player to miss the DC: a STR 14 Player (+2) can't get less than a 3, so why bother rolling against the Goblin?  This is actually a pretty reasonable outcome - we could leave the door open for critical failures (1-in-20, or 5%), but otherwise guarantee a victory.

### How about roll-under systems?

On its face, using a single roll-under check just seems wrong.  Our STR 10 Player has 50/50 odds of winning - it's a coin flip, whether our Player is facing the Goblin or the Ogre.  This seems like the worst case scenario - what player would be happy with this?

This isn't just a hypothetical.  Recently, I've been playing [**Electric Bastionland**](https://bastionlandpress.com), which takes precisely this approach - "the side most at risk makes a save."

"Madness", I thought!  Surely we need to bring in modifiers, or advantage/disadvantage, or *something* to balance the odds of this roll.  So I searched and found [this great article by Electric Bastionland's author, Chris McDowall](https://www.bastionland.com/2020/03/difficulty-in-bastionland.html), in which he says specifically NOT to tack on additional mechanics like advantage or modifiers.  Instead, he proposes a different solution - and it's since become my favorite approach to this problem.

### Go back to the fiction.

Remember when our Ogre and Goblin were NPCs, and we just chose a winner without rolling?  We examined the fiction of the world, and picked an outcome based on common sense and the story we wanted to tell.

We can do something similar here, by _adjusting our definitions of success and failure_.

When my Player sizes up the Ogre, I'll say something like this:

> The Ogre flexes as she towers over you.  The odds of you winning are close to nil.
> 
> If you still want to try, roll a STR save.
> 
> If you fail, she beats you handily.
> 
> If you pass?  You'll still lose, but you'll put up a good fight, and people will notice.
> 
> If you roll a critical success?  Well against all odds, you actually win it!

When my Player sizes up the Goblin, I'll say something like this:

> The tiny Goblin cowers before you.  You could pick him up with one hand.
> 
> Even still, roll a STR save.
> 
> If you pass, you win effortlessly.
> 
> If you fail?  You'll still win, but not quite as easily as you thought.
> 
> If you roll a critical failure?  He wins somehow, and you'll never hear the end of it.

There are several perks to this approach:

* The math is simple enough to calculate the odds on the fly, with no ties or rerolls.
* No need for ability scores for NPCs, just a sense of what *ought* to happen.
* It still leaves the door open for unlikely upsets at a static 5%.

This approach also dovetails nicely with Electric Bastionland's "ability loss" mechanic, where ability scores are temporarily lowered as players take damage - so a good night's sleep could very well be the difference between winning and losing.

Is this an accurate way to simulate this encounter?  Not particularly.  But to me, these are stakes that sound fun and memorable, and I'm willing to sacrifice precision for compelling story outcomes that still feel *fair enough* to the players.

It's also important to be consistent with your rulings.  Once established, players will come to rely on these rulings when coming up with plans, so future arm-wrestling bouts against similar opponents should follow this same pattern.

### Do we really need opposed rolls?

Today, this is the approach I use.  I love how fast it is, how straightforward it is to calculate odds on the fly, and how it prioritizes GM judgement to ensure fictional outcomes that make sense.

I also love to offer tough choices and make deals with players, which I find more engaging than just jumping straight to a d20 roll.

Granted, this might not work for everyone!  My games typically prioritize tempo, player choice, and managing risk - so quick, intuitive, player-facing rolls work well for me.  But more simulation-minded tables will probably want to invest in a system with robust dice mechanics - and there are a LOT of options beyond a single d20.

That being said, there is still ONE case where I will pull out the roll-high-under opposed roll - player-vs-player contests.  What alternative do I have - both players expect to roll!  But this case is so exceedingly rare that I'm happy to let them go for it - and things like "ties" provide meaningful narrative opportunities to intervene.

What have you tried?  What's worked for you?
