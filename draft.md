title: The Arm-Wrestling Contest
subtitle: Or, Why I Ditched Opposed Rolls
---

Imagine our RPG is hosting an arm-wrestling contest.  All of our contestants have a Strength (STR) stat, generated by rolling **3d6**.  This gives us 16 possible strength scores ranging from 3 to 18, representing the full range of human ability.  How do we determine the winner?

In the first corner, this pitiful little Goblin!

![A pitiful little goblin](/images/goblin.png)

* He rolled all ones on his STR roll
* He's as weak as the weakest ~6% of humans
* There's no way he's gonna win this thing.

In the next corner, this mighty Ogre!

![A massive, flexing ogre](/images/ogre.jpg)

* She rolled all sixes on her STR roll
* She's as strong as the strongest ~6% of humans
* She's a lock to win this.

So, how do we determine who wins the arm wrestling contest?

We could just compare strength scores directly, but then the Ogre ALWAYS wins.  Surely there's some set of circumstances, however unlikely, where the Goblin wins?  So we'll randomize the outcome by having each contestant roll a **d20**.

Our Goblin rolled a **12**, and our Ogre rolled **9**.  How do we incorporate our STR stat?

### Roll-High: Add a Modifier

For the last 20 years of D&D, we start by converting our stat into a **modifier** - subtract 10, divide by 2, and round down, like so:

| STR | Mod | | STR | Mod |
|-----|-----| |-----|-----|
|  3  | -4  | | 11  |  0  |
|  4  | -3  | | 12  |  1  |
|  5  | -3  | | 13  |  1  |
|  6  | -2  | | 14  |  2  |
|  7  | -2  | | 15  |  2  |
|  8  | -1  | | 16  |  3  |
|  9  | -1  | | 17  |  3  |
| 10  |  0  | | 18  |  4  |

Our modifiers range from **-4** to **+4**, which we add to our **d20** roll when making stat checks.

When two characters roll against each other (an **opposed check**), the highest roll wins (a **roll-high** system).  Once we've got these modifiers captured on the character sheet, this approach is straightforward and intuitive - add your modifier, higher is better.

Our Goblin has a modifier of **-4**, and our Ogre has a modifier of **+4**.  Adding these modifiers to their rolls, our Goblin has an **8**, and our Ogre has a **13** - the Ogre wins!

Looking at the odds, our [Ogre will roll above the Goblin ~81% of the time](https://anydice.com/program/1f8b3) (thanks AnyDice!).  But our Ogre is a beefcake and the Goblin is puny - how could the Goblin still win ~17% of the time?  

Well, our modifier is compressing our stat skill across the 3-18 range.  We lose granularity - 10 vs. 13 STR is the same mechanically as 11 vs. 12 STR.  This compression becomes particularly evident with opposed rolls.

### Can we roll against our stats directly?

Modifiers have been standard fare in D&D since 2000 with 3rd Edition, but previous editions (and many other games) use **roll-under** checks - roll at-or-below your stat to succeed.  (Some versions only consider rolling under your stat a success, but same idea.)

Roll-under has some distinct advantantages over modifiers: a **d20** fits nicely across our 3-18 scale, and every point of STR counts, with no compression.

Can we use roll-under for opposed checks?  If the Goblin and Ogre both roll STR checks, [there's a ~76% chance the Ogre passes and the Goblin does not](https://anydice.com/program/1f8c0) - pretty comparable to the 80% of our modifier approach.  As above, the Goblin's original roll of **12** fails and the Ogre's roll of **9** succeeds.

But what if they both pass, or both fail?  If our Ogre and Goblin both rolls a **1**, who wins?

We could add some kind of tiebreaker, say, comparing STR scores, whenever both contestants pass or fail. But this chance of tiebreakers increases as the STR spread narrows.  [A 17 STR Ogre and 18 STR Ogre will tie 78% of the time](https://anydice.com/program/1f8c1) - we'd expect the odds for these Ogres to be near 50/50, but the 18 STR Ogre will win 92% of the time.

This poses a practical problem for opposed checks, but we still have options - we'll revisit roll-under systems again later.

### Roll-High-Under - Stat Blackjack

There's another **d20** mechanic called **roll-high-under**, used most notably in old-school D&D-inspired [Whitehack](https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/).  Also known as "Blackjack", I describe this to players as "Price Is Right" rules - roll at-or-under your STR stat, *the higher the better*.

Unlike roll-under systems, we can resolve our opposed arm-wrestling check without a tiebreaker, even if both succeed - the higher roll wins.  With roll-high-under, [our Goblin now only wins ~9% of the time](https://anydice.com/program/1f8c5), which feels a little more intuitive.

Roll-high-under has other perks (see Whitehack's slick handling of Armor Class), but it's not without its faults.  For example, what happens if both contestants fail their rolls?  We might say the contestants are locked in struggle, and have them both reroll.  But imagine two STR 3 Goblins - [they'll both fail their STR check 72% of the time](https://anydice.com/program/1f8c7), and so might require several rerolls to determine a winner.

But there's another, more practical problem with roll-high-under systems.  Despite its elegance - and it pains me to say this - roll-high-under can be slow and unintuitive for players at the table.

For example, how do we handle critical successes and fumbles?  In a roll-high system, rolling 20 is best and 1 is worst.  For roll-under systems, this is reversed - 1 good, 20 bad.  (This can be an adjustment for players raised on modern D&D, but it's still immediately recognizable the moment the die finishes rolling.)

But for roll-high-under systems, a critical success is *rolling your stat exactly*.  This might be recognizable to the player who rolled it, but means a delayed reaction at best for the rest of the table.

### A hero walks into the bar..

Not just any hero either, but a Player Character, who's sitting at our game table.  This must mean our Goblin and Ogre must be non-player characters, with their fate in the hands of the GM.  Does this change our scenario?  Should the GM roll dice to determine the outcome of the Goblin and Ogre's arm-wrestling match?

Consider the case where the Goblin wins.  Granted, it's unlikely, but entirely possible.  So the GM explains: the Goblin and Ogre compete, and the Goblin emerges victorious.  The players look at the GM - huh?  How did this happen?  _Why_ did this happen?  "The Goblin just got lucky with a dice roll" is not a satisfactory explanation.

The fiction matters.  Think quick.

* Maybe the Goblin had an incredible breakfast that morning.
* Maybe the Goblin spotted his long-lost father in the crowd.
* Maybe the Goblin's favorite song just came on the jukebox.
* Maybe the Ogre had bad sushi for lunch.
* Maybe the Ogre just remembered she left her front door unlocked.
* Maybe the Ogre is on a ten-match losing streak and has a terrible case of The Yips.

Now the players are intrigued.  And who can blame them?  This is unusual - maybe they can use this to their advantage, somehow?  The Goblin-Ogre Upset could derail the whole session, as it provides lots of hooks for players to investigate.  Maybe they attend the Goblin celebration after-party.  Maybe they console the dejected Ogre.  Maybe they hassle their bookie for better odds next time.  What started as one random quirk of the dice has now become canon in-game.

Mostly?  This is fine!  Just a fun bit of color.  But as GM, did we really *need* the dice here?  If we WANTED the upset as a plot hook (and maybe had prepped some ideas to develop it), why would we leave this up to a 1-in-10 dice roll?  Conversely, if the Ogre was sure to win, why would we bother rolling?  As GM, we can just declare the winner, however best serves the fiction of the game.

### Then our hero decides to enter the contest.

The next challenger - a perfectly average Player Character!  They rolled a STR of 10, absolutely middle of the road.  We can't just declare a winner here - our Player absolutely expects to roll some dice to determine their fate.  So, what are our options?

Of course, we could do a simple opposed roll, as discussed above, with the GM rolling on behalf of the Player's opponent.

If we're playing Modern D&D, our human player gets an entirely average +0 modifier to add to their roll.  Against the Ogre, [our Player has a 30% chance of winning](https://anydice.com/program/1f8cf), and [a 66% chance of winning against the Goblin](https://anydice.com/program/1f8d0).  This.. seems wrong.  Even our decidely-average Human Player should still almost always beat the Goblin, at least more than two-thirds of the time.

What if we're playing a roll-high-under system?  Well, the odds are a bit more realistic - [our Player has a 16% chance of beating the Ogre](https://anydice.com/program/1f97b), and [only an 8% chance of losing to the Goblin](https://anydice.com/program/1f97e).  But our roll-high-under issues persist - there's a 43% chance the Human will *tie* against the Goblin, which feels a little odd.

So - here is our predicament.

* Our Human Player expects roll dice to determine whether they beat their opponent.
* The outcome should _make sense_, in game - the Human should almost always beat the Goblin and almost always lose to the Ogre.
* Our dice mechanic should be intuitive, decisive, and reasonably simple.  We want to avoid complicated math, lookup tables, or rerolls.

### Do we really need opposed rolls?

So much of these odds are complicated by comparing the outcome of two opposed rolls.  What if we ditch them?  After all, we only really *need* the Player to roll - is it possible for their roll alone to determine the outcome?  The Goblin and Ogre are just NPCs.  As long as the odds still make sense, this would greatly simplifies our procedure.

This approach works pretty well with ability score modifiers.  The GM just sets a static, target difficulty (**DC**) for each opponent - a low difficulty for Goblin and a high difficulty for the Ogre.  We could even use their opponent's strength as a static target to beat!  This gives us [a 90% chance of beating the Goblin and a 15% chance of beating the Ogre](https://anydice.com/program/1f981).  To me, this feels much more accurate than opposed modifier rolls, and with a much simpler process to boot.

The main flaw with this approach is the same as before.  Our modifier lacks granularity - we only see a 5% difference in odds between a STR 10 (+0) and a STR 13 (+1) character.  Also, as players get stronger, it also becomes impossible for the player to lose - a 14 STR Player (+2) can't get less than a 3, so why bother rolling?  This is actually pretty reasonable when using a modifier approach - we could leave the door open for critical failures (1-in-20, or 5%), but otherwise guarantee a victory.

### How about roll-under systems?

Using a single roll-under check just seems wrong - our STR 10 Human has 50/50 odds of winning.  Worse, this entirely ignores the opponent - it's a coin flip, whether our Player is facing the Goblin or the Ogre.  Honestly, this seems like the worst case scenario.  What player would be happy with this?

This isn't just a hypothetical.  Recently, I've been playing [Electric Bastionland](https://bastionlandpress.com), which takes precisely this approach - "the side most at risk makes a save."

"Madness", I thought!  Surely we need to bring in modifiers, or advantage/disadvantage, or SOMETHING to balance the odds of this roll.  So I Googled, and found [this great article by Electric Bastionland's author, Chris McDowall, on his blog](https://www.bastionland.com/2020/03/difficulty-in-bastionland.html), which said SPECIFICALLY not to tack additional difficulty mechanics like advantage or modifiers.  Instead, he proposed a different solution - and it's since become my favorite approach to this problem.

### Go back to the fiction.

Remember when our Ogre and Goblin were NPCs, and we could just pick a winner without rolling?  We examined the fiction of the world, and just picked something, based on our common sense and the story we wanted to tell.  We can do something similar here, by _adjusting our definition of success and failure_.

As GM, when my Player sizes up the Ogre, I'll say something like this:
> The Ogre flexes her muscles as she towers over you.  The odds of you beating her in an arm-wrestling contest are close to nil.
> If you still want to try, roll a STR save.
> If you fail, she beats you handily.
> If you succeed?  You're still gonna lose, but you'll put up a good fight, and people will notice.
> If you roll a critical success?  Well then, somehow, you actually win it!

As GM, when my Player sizes up the Goblin, I'll say something like this:
> The tiny Goblin cowers before you.  He looks like you could pick him up with one hand.
> Even still, roll a STR save.
> If you succeed, you win effortlessly.
> If you fail?  You'll still win, but not quite as easily as you thought.
> If you roll a critical failure?  Somehow, this Goblin beats you, and you'll never hear the end of it.

There are several perks to this approach:
* The math is simple enough to calculate the odds on the fly, with no ties or rerolls.
* It doesn't require having detailed stats for NPC, just an intuitive sense of what _ought_ to happen.
* It still leaves the door for unlikely upsets, because what table doesn't love crowing over a crit.

This also dovetails nicely with Electric Bastionland's "ability loss" mechanic, where stats are temporarily lowered as players take damage - so a good night's sleep very well could be the difference between winning and losing.

### Do we really need opposed rolls?

Today, this is the approach I use.  I love how fast it is, how easy it is to calculate odds on the fly, and how it prioritizes intuitive GM judgements to ensure fiction-focused outcomes.  I also love how this enables me to make deals and offer hard choices to players, which for my experience is more engaging than just jumping directly to a (potentially swingy) dice roll.

Granted, this might not work for everyone!  My game priorities typically center on tempo, player choice, and managing risk - so quick, intuitive, player-facing rolls work well for me.  But more simulation-minded tables will probably want to invest in a system with robust dice mechanics (and there are a LOT of options beyond a single **d20** roll).

That being said, there is still ONE case where I will pull out the roll-high-under opposed roll - player-vs-player contests.  I just don't see an alternative - both players expect to roll!  That being said, this case is so exceedingly rare that I'm happy to let them roll for it, and things like "ties" provide meaningful narrative opportunities instead of just slowing things down.
