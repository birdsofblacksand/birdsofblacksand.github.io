title: The All-Stock Arm Wrestling Championship
---

### Who's the strongest?  Let's have an arm-wrestling contest to find out.

All of our contestants have a STR stat, generated by rolling **3d6**.  This gives us 16 possible strength scores (3-18), representing the full range of human ability.  

In the first corner, this pitiful little Goblin!

![A pitiful little goblin](/images/goblin.png)

* He rolled all 1s on his 3d6 strength roll
* He's as weak as the weakest 6.25% of humans
* There's no way he's gonna win this thing.

In the next corner, this mighty Ogre!

![A massive, flexing ogre](/images/ogre.png)

* She rolled all 6s on her 3d6 strength roll
* She's as strong as the strongest 6.25% of humans
* She's a lock to win this.

So, how do we determine who wins the arm wrestling contest?

We could just compare strength scores directly, but then the Ogre ALWAYS wins.  Surely there's some set of circumstances, however unlikely, where the Goblin wins?  So, let's roll dice to determine if this unlikely event happens.

So we'll have each contestant roll a D20.  Our Goblin rolled a **13**, and our Ogre rolled **9**.  But how do we incorporate our STR stat?

### Ability Score Modifier

* In modern D&D (5e/4e/Pathfinder), we incorporate our STR score by calculating an **ability modifier**, adding them to our roll, and the higher roll wins.
* Calculate with `Modifier = FLOOR( (stat - 10) / 2 )`, i.e. "Difference from 10, divided by 2, rounded down"
* Make a STR check by rolling a d20 and adding your modifier, then roll above a target number.

* Opposed Modifier Rolls
    * For opposed rolls with ability modifiers, whoever rolls highest wins - it's a "roll-high" system.
    * So, our Goblin has a modifier of -4, and our Ogre has a modifier of +4.
    * So, our final rolls: Goblin rolls **9**, and Ogre rolls **17** - the Ogre wins!

* Looking at the odds
    * It turns out, our [Ogre will roll above the Goblin ~81% of the time](https://anydice.com/program/1f8b3) (thanks AnyDice!)
    * But our Ogre is an absolute beefcake, and the Goblin is absolutely puny - how could the Goblin still win ~17% of the time?
    * Our modifier is compressing skill across our natural 3-18 range, and this is particularly evident with opposed rolls.

* Pros and Cons of Ability Modifiers
    * Pro: rolling "higher is better" is quite intuitive
    * Con: need to track two different numbers on our character sheet
    * Con: loss of granularity - 10 vs. 13 Strength is the same mechanically as 11 vs. 12 Strength

* Can we roll against our stats directly?
    * Today's "Old School Revival" D&D is largely based on **Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set** (released in 1981) which uses "roll-under" ability checks.
    * Simply roll your stat or lower on a d20 to succeed a check.
    * Roll-under has its shortcomings, but suffers from none of the issues that affect modifiers.
    * It's granular, intuitive, and requires no math, plus fits nicely with a 3-18 stat scale.

* Can we use roll-under for opposed checks?
    * If the Goblin and Ogre both roll STR checks, [there's a ~76% chance the Ogre passes and the Goblin does not](https://anydice.com/program/1f8c0).
    * This is pretty comparable to our ability score modifier likelihood of 80%.
    * In our example above, the Goblin's roll of **13** fails and the Ogre's roll of **9** succeeds.
    * But what if they both pass, or both fail?  If our Ogre and Goblin both rolls a **1**, who wins?

* We could introduce a tiebreaker.
    * Say, compare STR scores whenever both contestants pass.
    * But this chance of tiebreakers increases as the skill spread narrows.
    * [A 17 STR and 18 STR Ogre will tie 78% of the time](https://anydice.com/program/1f8c1).
    * We'd expect these odds to be near 50/50, but instead become more like 92/8.  Not great.

* Roll-high-under
    * There's another d20 mechanic we can use here called "roll-high-under", used in [the popular OSR game Whitehack](https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/).
    * I describe this to players as the "Price Is Right" roll - roll your stat or under, the higher the better.
    * Now, we can resolve our arm wrestling check with a single roll from each contestant, without math.
    * As above, the Goblin's roll of **13** fails and the Ogre's roll of **9** succeeds.
    * In this scenario, [our Goblin now only wins ~9% of the time](https://anydice.com/program/1f8c5).

* Problems with roll-high-under
    * Pretty handy, huh!  Roll-high-under has a couple other perks as well (see Whitehack's slick handling of Armor Class), but it's not without its fault.
    * For example, what happens if both contestants fail their rolls?  We might say the contestants are locked in struggle and reroll.
    * But imagine two STR 3 Goblins - [they'll both fail their STR check 72% of the time](https://anydice.com/program/1f8c7), and so might require several rerolls.

* But there's another, more practical problem with roll-high-under systems - they can be unintuitive for players at the table.
    * For example, how do we handle a critical successes and fumbles?  In a roll-high system, rolling 20 is best and 1 is worst.
    * For roll-under systems, this is reversed - less popular today, but still immediately recognizable the moment the die finishes rolling.  1 good, 20 bad.
    * But for roll-high-under systems, a critical success is *rolling your stat exactly*.
    * This might be recognizable to the player who rolled it, but means a delayed reaction at best for the rest of the table.

* But then, some heroes walk into the bar..
    * Not just any heroes either, but the Player Characters sitting around our game table.
    * Our Goblin and Ogre must be non-player-characters, then, with their fate in the hands of the GM.
    * Does this change our scenario?  Should the GM being rolling dice to determine the outcome of the Goblin and Ogre's arm-wrestling match?

* Consider the case where the Goblin wins.
    * Granted, it's unlikely, but entirely possible.  So the GM explains: the Goblin and Ogre compete, and the Goblin emerges victorious.
    * Inevitably, the players look towards the GM - what?  How?  The Ogre is a beefcake, the Goblin is tiny - what just happened?
   
* The fiction matters.  Think quick.
    * Maybe the Goblin had an incredible breakfast that morning.  Maybe the Goblin spotted his long-lost father in the crowd.  Maybe the Goblin's favorite song came on the jukebox.
    * Maybe the Ogre had bad sushi for lunch.  Maybe the Ogre just remembered she left her front door unlocked.  Maybe the Ogre is on a ten-match losing streak and has a terrible case of The Yips.

* Now the players are intrigued.
    * If your table is anything like mine, players now want to know _why_ this happened, or at least, how they can use it to their advantage.
    * Like it or not, the in-game fiction has shifted, and potentially the players' motivations with it.
    * And who can blame them.  Clearly, this upset happened for a reason, and they'd be remiss not to investigate.

* But it _could_ become more than that.
    * The Goblin-Ogre Upset could derail the whole session, as it provides lots of hooks for players investigate.
    * Maybe they attend the Goblin celebration.  Maybe they console the dejected Ogre.  Maybe they hassle their bookie for better odds next time.
    * This one random quirk of the dice has now become *canon* in-game.

* Mostly, this is fine.
    * Just a fun bit of color, mostly.  But as GM, did we _need_ the dice here?
    * If we WANTED the upset as a plot hook (and had prepped some ideas to develop it), why would we leave this up to a 1-in-10 dice roll?
    * Conversely, if we had every expectation the Ogre would win, why would we bother rolling?
    * As GM, we can just declare the winner, however best serves the fiction of the game.

* Then our heroes decide to enter the contest.
    * Up first, a perfectly average Human Player Character!
    * They rolled a STR of 10, absolutely middle of the road.
    * We can't just declare a winner here - our Player will absolutely expect to roll some dice to determine their fate.

* So, what are our options?
    * Of course, we could do a simple opposed roll, as discussed above, with the GM rolling on behalf of the Player's opponent.
    * If we're playing Modern D&D, our human player gets an entirely average +0 modifier to add to their roll.
    * Against the Ogre, [our Player has a 30% chance of winning](https://anydice.com/program/1f8cf), and [a 66% chance of winning against the Goblin](https://anydice.com/program/1f8d0).
    * This seems wrong.  Our decidely average Human Player should still almost always beat the Goblin, definitely more than two-thirds of the time.

* What if we're playing a roll-high-under system?
    * Well, the odds are a bit more realistic - [our Player has a 16% chance of beating the Ogre](https://anydice.com/program/1f97b), and [only an 8% chance of losing to the Goblin](https://anydice.com/program/1f97e).
    * But our roll-high-under issues persist - there's a 43% chance the Human will *tie* against the Goblin, which feels a little odd.

* So - here is our predicament.
    * Our Human Player expects roll dice to determine whether they beat their opponent.
    * The outcome should _make sense_, in game - the Human should almost always beat the Goblin and almost always lose to the Ogre.
    * Our dice mechanic should be intuitive, decisive, and reasonably simple.  We want to avoid complicated math, lookup tables, or rerolls.

* What if we ditch opposed rolls?
    * What if only the player rolls, and this single roll determines the outcome?
    * As long as the odds still make sense, this greatly simplifies our procedure, and focuses on the experience of players, not NPCS.

* Modifiers
    * This approach works pretty well with ability score modifiers - the GM can set a low difficulty for Goblin and a high difficulty for the Ogre.
    * We could even use their opponent's strength as a static target to beat!  This gives us [a 90% chance of beating the Goblin and a 15% chance of beating the Ogre](https://anydice.com/program/1f981).
    * To me, this feels much more accurate than opposed modifier rolls, and with a much simpler process to boot.

* The main flaw with this approach is the same as before.
    * Our modifier lacks granularity - we only see a 5% difference in odds between a STR 10 (+0) and a STR 13 (+1) character.

* How about roll-under systems?
    * A single roll-under check seems wrong - our STR 10 Human has 50/50 odds of winning.
    * Worse, this entirely ignores the opponent - it's a coin flip, whether our Player is facing the Goblin or the Ogre.
    * Honestly, this seems like the worst case scenario.  What player would be happy with this?

* This isn't just a hypothetical.
    * Recently, I've been playing [Electric Bastionland](https://bastionlandpress.com), which takes precisely this approach.
    * "Madness", I thought!  Surely we need to bring in modifiers, or advantage/disadvantage, or SOMETHING to balance the odds of this roll.
    * So I googled, and found [this article by Electric Bastionland's author, Chris McDowall, on his blog](https://www.bastionland.com/2020/03/difficulty-in-bastionland.html), which said SPECIFICALLY not to tack additional difficulty mechanics like advantage or modifiers.
    * Instead, he proposed a different solution - and it's since become my favorite approach to this problem.

* Go back to the fiction.
    * Remember when our Ogre and Goblin were NPCs, and we could just pick a winner without rolling?
    * We adjusted the fiction of the world, based on what made intuitive sense, and the story we wanted to tell.
    * We can do something similar here, by _adjusting our definition of success and failure_.

* As GM, when my Player sizes up the Ogre, I'll say something like this:
    * The Ogre flexes her muscles as she towers over you.  The odds of you beating her in an arm-wrestling contest are close to nil.
    * If you still want to try, roll a STR save.
    * If you fail, she beats you handily.
    * If you succeed?  You're still gonna lose, but you'll put up a good fight, and people will notice.
    * If you roll a critical success?  Well, then you actually win it!

* As GM, when my Player sizes up the Goblin, I'll say something like this:
    * The tiny Goblin cowers before you.  He looks like you could pick him up with one hand.
    * Even still, roll a STR save.
    * If you succeed, you win effortlessly.
    * If you fail?  You'll still win, but not quite as easily as you thought.
    * If you roll a critical failure?  Somehow, this Goblin beats you, and you'll never hear the end of it.

* There are several perks to this approach:
    * The math is simple enough to calculate the odds on the fly, with no ties or rerolls.
    * It doesn't require having detailed stats for NPC, just an intuitive sense of what _ought_ to happen.
    * It still leaves the door for unlikely upsets, because what table doesn't love crowing over a crit.

* This is the approach for me.
    * Might not work for everyone!
    * There are better opposed solutions for the more simulation-minded tables beyond what I outlined here.
